# Enhancing Patient Safety through Remote-Controlled Robotics for Intravenous Administration  

## Overview  
This project addresses the challenge of healthcare-associated infections caused by frequent nurse-patient contact during IV dosage adjustments. By creating a remote-controlled IV pump system, this project enhances patient safety, reduces infection risk, and improves hospital efficiency.  

The team designed and prototyped a system that allows healthcare providers to control an Alaris BD IV pump remotely through a Raspberry Pi interface. This enables dosage changes without entering patient rooms, minimizing exposure and saving valuable medical staff time.

## Approach  
1. **Research and Reverse Engineering**  
   - Investigated communication pathways between the BD Alaris PC Unit and its keypad using logic analyzers.  
2. **Hardware Integration**  
   - Connected each button to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to emulate the keypadâ€™s input signals.  
3. **Software Development**  
   - Developed Raspberry Pi software to interpret and send control signals to the PCU, providing both wired and wireless control options.  
4. **Prototype Development**  
   - Built a digital prototype displaying system interactions and verified its physical implementation using LEDs and wiring to show data transmission.  
5. **Testing and Validation**  
   - Measured response time, accuracy, and reliability of remote commands under various conditions.
